# my first post

h-hello world!
*taps microphone*
is this thing on . . . ?

hi reader, welcome to my site!

## let's set some ground rules:
1. **lowercase**: you've figured this out by now, but rule #1 is that i only write in lowercase.
2. **maturity**: this site intends to act as a portfolio, but it's still my personal site. not everything is intended to be "professional-grade".
3. **fun**: most importantly, it's a site for fun. there's going to be hidden gems and inside jokes, because i'm having fun!

## what's next?

well, i'm not sure yet.
i've got this project already up & running on my super cool vps (virtual private server) served at blake-sama.com (you already knew this)
so now i'm just free to develop it!

this blog style "posts" section is my first "project" here on blake-sama.com, just to get something set up that i can yap about later. probably after this i'll spend time on the home page and add all my socials.
