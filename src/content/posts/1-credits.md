there are several people, websites, and other inspirations that have helped me create and design this site.
some of which you may even see a striking resemblance to . . . and well, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!

## websites and what they inspired
**orangc** - [orangc.net](https://orangc.net/) - my original inspiration. i saw orangec's site while reading through the [hyprland](hypr.land) [discord](https://discord.com/invite/hQ9XvMUjjr) and immediately fell in love with it. 
- the most obvious thing i took inspiration from is the dynamic rendering of my username based on the social media link/icon you hover over.

and while this list may be short at the time of creating it, i eagerly anticipate that it will grow over the course of the future.
